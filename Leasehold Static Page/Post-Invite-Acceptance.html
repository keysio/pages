                                                <p>Once you have agreed an offer on your house, you need to get a legal professional (solicitor or conveyancer) to act on your behalf to handle the legal work to transfer ownership of the property to you. Find and compare conveyancing quotes from regulated and reviewed conveyancing solicitors that cover your area. Solicitors are usually more expensive than conveyancers and are qualified lawyers, so they can offer a full range of legal services. Licenced conveyancers are specialised in property but can't deal with complex legal issues.</p>
